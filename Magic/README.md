With Cosmic Nexus of Omnipotence, she fuses every potent form of magic: elemental chaos, cosmic awareness, divine intervention, time manipulation, and reality alteration. This card is not merely a representation of magic; it is the essence of all magic and reality coalesced into one singular, transcendent entity. The battlefield morphs into a cosmic theater where the very fabric of existence can be woven, torn, and restructured at her will. Enemies don't merely lose; they are absorbed into the ever-expanding tapestry of her dominion, forever a part of a new, reshaped reality. Her presence doesn't change the game.
