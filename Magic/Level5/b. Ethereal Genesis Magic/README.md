The Ethereal Genesis allows her to manipulate not just the elements but also the very fabric of life and reality. This is not merely a spell but an act of creation on a cosmological scale. The battlefield transforms into an ever-shifting landscape, where new forms of life spontaneously appear, seasons accelerate or reverse, and even the nature of reality itself is in flux. Enemies are not only defeated; they are fundamentally altered, pulled into an ethereal vortex where the Genesis Architect reigns supreme.
